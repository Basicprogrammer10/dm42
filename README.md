# dm42 [![Build](https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/dm42/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/dm42/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Various programs for the [Swissmicros DM42](https://www.swissmicros.com/product/dm42) and a preprocessor / transpiler for creating them.

## Programs

- [Statistics](bin#statistics) &mdash; Various statistics functions for use on NÃ—1 matrices
- [Fractions](bin#fractions) &mdash; Operations for working with exact fractions
- [Unit converter](bin#unit-converter) &mdash; A simple unit convertor
- [Physical Constants](bin#physical-constants) &mdash; Lets you push various physical constants onto the stack
- [Matrix Sorter](bin#matrix-sorter) &mdash; Sorts a matrix column, used in the statistics program

## Preprocessor

This code makes uses of function definitions, if statements, and while loops and can be compiled down into plain 42s instructions.
If you decide to work with this language and use vs code, consider installing the [language grammars](grammer) for pretty syntax highlighting.

```cpp
export def sort {
    if { MAT? } else {
        "X is not a matrix", AVIEW
        STOP
    }

    STO "A"
    INDEX "A"
    1, 1, STOIJ
    DROPN 2

    while { FC? 76 } {
        [MIN]
        DROP
        RCLIJ
        DROP
        R<>R
        DROPN 2
        I+
    }

    RCL "A"
}
```

## Documentation

This is for when I inevitability forget all of this syntax that I totally put so much thought into.
Anyway, there are currently four things added by this transpiler / preprocessor, Functions, Function calls, If statements, and While (or Do-while) loops.
Below are some examples of each.

```cpp
// Zeros out the X reg by repeatedly subtracting 1
// Because the function is being exported, it will be globally accessibly (in the EXQ menu)
export def zero {
    // Each block here must return one value by putting it in X
    // The value will be dropped before any other user code is run
    // To use a do-while loop, one must simple replace "while" with "do while"
    while { DUP } > { 0 } {
        // This expands to "1\n"
        1, -
    }
}

export def cmat {
    // This kind of condition without the comparison lets you bring your own instruction to selectively execute the following instruction
    // Also notice the missing then case, this was done to basically invert the result of MAT?
    if { MAT? } else {
        "X is not a matrix", AVIEW
        // Calls the "zero" function from above
        zero()
        STOP
    }
}
```
